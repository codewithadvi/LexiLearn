**LexiLearn AI** is a full-stack, AI-enhanced web application designed to optimize learning through an intelligent **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**. It goes beyond traditional flashcards by verifying user answers for *semantic correctness* and providing *dynamic AI-generated hints*, ensuring a truly adaptive and effective study experience.

##  Key Features

LexiLearn AI combines proven learning science with modern AI capabilities:

*  **Spaced Repetition System (SRS):** Implements an efficient algorithm (based on **SM-2 principles**) using a **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)** to intelligently schedule card reviews, prioritizing cards the user is most likely to forget.
*  **AI-Powered Answer Verification:** Utilizes the **Groq API (Llama 3)** to perform *semantic analysis* of user-typed answers, ensuring correctness based on meaning, not just exact string matching.
*  **AI-Generated Hints:** Provides *on-demand, context-aware hints* generated by AI to guide users without giving away the answer.
*  **Secure User Authentication:** Features a robust **JWT-based authentication system**, ensuring each user's decks and progress are private.
*  **Full CRUD Operations:** Seamlessly Create, Read, Update, and Delete decks and flashcards.
*  **Modern Full-Stack Architecture:** Built with a decoupled **React frontend** and **FastAPI backend**, following professional design patterns.
*  **Dynamic & Responsive UI:** Clean, dark-themed interface built with React Hooks and Context API for efficient state management.

##  Technology Stack & Architecture

LexiLearn AI leverages a modern, robust technology stack chosen for performance, scalability, and developer experience.

###  Backend (Python / FastAPI)

-   **Language:** Python 3.9+
-   **Framework:** FastAPI (async capabilities + Pydantic validation)
-   **Server:** Uvicorn (ASGI server)
-   **Database:** SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite (easily adaptable to PostgreSQL)
-   **AI Integration:** Groq API (via `groq` library)
-   **Authentication:** `python-jose` (JWT), `passlib[bcrypt]` (Password Hashing)
-   **Data Structures:** Python’s built-in `heapq` for Priority Queue
-   **Architecture:** MVC-like pattern — Routers, Services, Models, Schemas for clear separation of concerns

### Frontend (React / Vite)

-   **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
-   **Framework:** React 18+ (using Hooks)
-   **Build Tool:** Vite
-   **Routing:** `react-router-dom`
-   **State Management:** React Context API
-   **API Communication:** `axios`
-   **Styling:** CSS Variables + Component-scoped Inline Styles

##  Core Algorithms & Concepts

LexiLearn AI isn’t just a CRUD app — it integrates intelligent logic for adaptive learning.

###  Spaced Repetition System (SRS) & Priority Queue

-   Each flashcard tracks `next_review_date`, `interval`, and `ease_factor`.
-   When fetching the next card, the backend queries all *due* cards.
-   These cards are inserted into a **Min-Heap** using Python’s `heapq`.
-   Extracting the minimum (`heapq.heappop`) guarantees the *most overdue card* is selected first. Time complexity: `O(log n)`.

###  AI Semantic Answer Verification

1.  User input is sent to the backend.
2.  The `_verify_answer_with_ai` service function sends a crafted prompt to the Groq API.
3.  The AI compares semantic meaning between the user's and correct answer.
4.  Returns a Boolean (`True` or `False`) based on conceptual correctness.
5.  The result updates SRS parameters (interval, ease factor, next review).

###  AI Hint Generation

-   `get_hint_for_card` sends the card’s question and answer to the Groq API.
-   The AI generates a concise hint that helps without revealing the full answer.
